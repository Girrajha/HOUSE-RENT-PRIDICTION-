Project Title: House Rent Prediction
Name: Girraj Jha
Type: Self Project
Domain: Machine Learning / Data Science
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
Project Description:
The House Rent Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the rental cost of a house based on key features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and more.

As part of this self-initiated project, I explored a real-world dataset to understand the patterns and trends in house rentals. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using regression algorithms.

Objectives:
To analyze the key factors affecting house rent prices.

To build a predictive model that estimates house rent based on user inputs.

To evaluate and compare different regression models for better accuracy.

Key Features Used:
Location

Size (sq. ft.)

Number of bedrooms (BHK)

Furnishing status

Bathroom count

Floor level

Building type / Property type

Approach:
Data Collection: Acquired a public dataset from Kaggle or similar source.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variable encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature relationships and rent distributions.

Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Implemented and tested algorithms like:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor

Evaluation Metrics: Used MAE, MSE, and R² score to evaluate model performance.

Result: Achieved an R² score of approximately [add your result] on test data, indicating good predictive performance.
